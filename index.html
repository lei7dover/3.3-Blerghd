            I continue to be in awe of how much my life has completely changed in a matter of 9 months. Just a short time ago, I was a teacher. I took a leap of faith & followed God's call. Just 2 months later, I started a new job as Customer support representative at a software company in Akron(I get to work remote several days a week). In 2 weeks, I'm heading to a bootcamp in Indianapolis for 3 months of intense immersion in Ruby programming. I'll come away a junior developer. I could have never imagined God had this in store for me. And that's just professionally speaking, not to mention the pretty cool guy God allowed our paths to cross back in February(this you are all well aware of by now hehe).
          </p>
          <p>
            So for me & all of us that struggle trusting God because we can't see what is coming...I hope this gives you hope. Now I realize we've all had God show up in our lives big time yet we still struggle to trust in those times of ...waiting & wondering ..how will you use this...what are you doing in this time... etc. but my hope is that my story gives you hope that God IS working & will bless you beyond anything you could even imagine- so be patient & ask Him what He wants to do in your life. Follow Him no matter how hard or crazy it may seem to the "outside" world. No one else is God & no one else knows about your personal relationship & what God is calling you to. If you've prayed about it & God has given you the peace & all things are falling into place ...ONLY GOD can provide that in the midst of uncertainty & craziness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I ask for prayer. I'm so blessed by this opportunity but I am for sure nervous. I'll be in the midst of this bootcamp in the middle of a big foreign city living alone in an apartment building for the 1st time in 26 years. Also please pray for Scott & I's relationship as I will be doing 60-80 hrs of code each week & it's going to be taxing on me. Of course we will only be 4 hours apart but a lot of my weekends will be spent doing my hw due Sunday evening. Finally, that during these 3 months- I really grow closer to God & lean on him gaining a deeper dependence than ever before.
            Thanks in advance for all the support & prayers. I truly appreciate it!
          </p>
